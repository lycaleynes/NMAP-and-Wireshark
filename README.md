<h1>NMAP and Wireshark</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>In the changing field of cybersecurity, we need to continually identify new threats to your network as evidenced in the network itself and the traffic on that network. We need to know how to run network mapping and monitoring software to find vulnerabilities and anomalies that could impact the security of your network in order to recommend sound solutions.</p>

<p>For this task, I used the virtual world at the “Performance Assessment Lab” web link from my school and accessed the files and lab environment necessary to run both Nmap and Wireshark on the network associated with this task. I also recommended solutions to address any issues I have found.</p>

<h2>Analysis</h2>

<ins><b>Network Topology</b></ins>



<p>This network topology is a star topology with a central node labeled "localhost," which acts as the hub. Several nodes are connected directly to this central hub via dashed lines, representing their network connections. Each connected node is identified by its IP address, with six nodes in total: 10.168.27.1, 10.168.27.132, 10.168.27.20, 10.168.27.14, 10.168.27.10, and 10.168.27.15.</p>

<ins><b>Unethical Practices</b></ins>

<p>One unethical practice involved Nadia Johnson and her conflict of interest with Carl Jaspers. Johnson's close social relationship with Jaspers and the positive reviews she received from him created a potential bias in her role as an IT Security Analyst. This unethical behavior could have led to her overlooking critical issues in her oversight of Jaspers' department. The conflict of interest undermined her ability to perform her job objectively, violating ethical standards of impartiality and professionalism.</p>

<p>A second unethical practice was carried out by Sarah Miller, who, as a senior analyst, led efforts to scan other companies' networks without authorization. This unethical behavior, which was illegal and violated the EC Council's guidelines on ethical penetration testing, set a poor example for her team members. By engaging in unauthorized network scanning, Miller disregarded professional standards and encouraged her team to participate in unethical activities.</p>

<ins><b>Factors</b></ins>

<p>One factor that led to lax ethical behavior at TechFite was the lack of a policy preventing conflicts of interest. Nadia Johnson’s close relationship with Carl Jaspers was not prohibited by any company guidelines, allowing her to engage in activities that compromised her professional integrity. The absence of this policy permitted the conflict of interest to continue unchecked, influencing Johnson’s actions and judgment in her role as IT Security Analyst.</p>

<p>Another factor was the absence of oversight and accountability within the BI Unit. Sarah Miller and her team could conduct unauthorized network scans without any repercussions. The lack of proper supervision and enforcement of ethical guidelines allowed these unethical behaviors to persist. Without a transparent system of checks and balances, employees like Miller were free to engage in unethical activities that endangered the company and external organizations.</p>

<ins><b>Information Security Policies</b></ins>

<p>One security policy that could have reduced unethical behavior is a Conflict of Interest Policy. This policy would explicitly prohibit close personal relationships between individuals responsible for security oversight and those they supervise, such as Nadia Johnson and Carl Jaspers. By implementing such a policy, TechFite could have avoided the conflict of interest that compromised Johnson’s professional responsibilities and reduced the potential for biased decision-making. This policy would also decrease the risk of unethical oversight in the future.</p>

<p>A second policy that could have reduced unethical behavior is a Penetration Testing Policy, which requires all penetration testing activities to be pre-approved and conducted within legal boundaries. If TechFite had enforced such a policy, it would have prevented Sarah Miller and her team from conducting unauthorized network scans on external companies. This policy would also ensure that any network security testing follows legal and ethical guidelines, reducing the risk of unethical behavior and protecting TechFite and its partners from legal repercussions.</p>

<ins><b>SATE Components</b></ins>

<p>One key component of the Security Awareness Training and Education (SATE) program that TechFite should adopt is requiring all employees to participate in conflict of interest training. This training would educate employees on how personal relationships could compromise their professional responsibilities and the importance of avoiding conflicts of interest. Ensuring all employees understand the implications of conflicts of interest, like the one involving Nadia Johnson, would prevent future unethical behavior and protect the company’s integrity.</p>

<p>Another critical component of the SATE program is establishing clear penalties for unauthorized activities. Employees like Sarah Miller and her team, who engaged in unauthorized network scanning, would face clear consequences for their actions. This component would help ensure that employees understand the importance of obtaining approval for all network security activities and that there are consequences for violating ethical and legal standards.</p>

<ins><b>SATE Program Communication</b></ins>

<p>The SATE program will be communicated to TechFite employees through official announcements from senior management, followed by detailed emails outlining the program’s components and expectations. TechFite will also hold mandatory training sessions to educate employees about conflicts of interest and authorized network security activities. This training will be delivered through in-person workshops and online modules to ensure all employees receive the necessary information.</p>

<ins><b>SATE Program Justification</b></ins>

<p>One undesirable behavior identified in Part A was Nadia Johnson’s conflict of interest with Carl Jaspers. To mitigate this, the SATE program will include training on recognizing and avoiding conflicts of interest. This training will ensure that employees understand the importance of maintaining professional boundaries and how conflicts of interest can damage the company’s reputation and integrity.</p>

<p>A second undesirable behavior was Sarah Miller’s unauthorized network scanning. The SATE program will include specific training on the legal and ethical boundaries of penetration testing. By educating employees about the importance of conducting only authorized network security activities, TechFite can prevent future incidents of unauthorized access and unethical behavior.</p>

<ins><b>Ethics Issues and Mitigation Summary for Management</b></ins>

<p>TechFite faces several ethical issues, including Nadia Johnson’s conflict of interest with Carl Jaspers and Sarah Miller’s unauthorized network scanning. These behaviors created significant risks for the company and its clients. To address these issues, I recommend implementing a Conflict of Interest Policy to prevent biased oversight and a Penetration Testing Policy to ensure all network security activities are conducted ethically and legally. The SATE program will also educate employees on avoiding conflicts of interest and conducting authorized penetration testing. These policies and training initiatives will mitigate future ethical issues and ensure that TechFite maintains the highest standards of integrity.</p>
